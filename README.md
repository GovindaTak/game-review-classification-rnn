# game-review-classification-rnn
This project is a Game Review Classification model using RNN and Word2Vec embeddings.  It processes user reviews to predict whether a player would recommend the game or not.  The pipeline includes text preprocessing (lemmatization, stopword removal, vectorization),  feature extraction using TF-IDF and Word2Vec, and training an RNN model.
