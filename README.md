# game-review-classification-rnn
This project is a Game Review Classification model using RNN and Word2Vec embeddings.  It processes user reviews to predict whether a player would recommend the game or not.  The pipeline includes text preprocessing (lemmatization, stopword removal, vectorization),  feature extraction using TF-IDF and Word2Vec, and training an RNN model.

## **Game Review Classification using RNN** 🎮  
📌 **Predicting Game Review Sentiments with Word2Vec & RNN**  

### **Overview**  
This project focuses on classifying **game reviews** based on user sentiment. We analyze user feedback and predict whether they would **recommend** the game or not. The model is built using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** with **Word2Vec embeddings**.

### **Project Pipeline**
✔️ **Step 1: Importing Dataset**  
- Used a dataset containing **game reviews** and their corresponding **recommendation labels (0/1)**.  

✔️ **Step 2: Text Preprocessing**  
- **Tokenization & Lemmatization** using `spaCy`.  
- **Stopword removal & punctuation cleanup**.  
- **POS Tagging & Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to enhance features.  

✔️ **Step 3: Embeddings (Feature Engineering)**  
- Used **TF-IDF Vectorization** for feature extraction.  
- Built **Word2Vec embeddings** (100-dimensional) trained on our dataset.  

✔️ **Step 4: Modeling with RNN**  
- Implemented an **RNN Model in PyTorch**.  
- Used **Leaky ReLU activation** and **dropout regularization**.  
- Trained for **30 epochs with early stopping**.
